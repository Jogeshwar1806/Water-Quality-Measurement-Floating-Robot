# Water Quality Measurement Floating Robot

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robotic device that floats on water and measures water quality using sensor-enabled technology. The device features a robotic arm equipped with various sensors to monitor critical parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and turbidity. It is designed to provide real-time water quality data, ideal for applications like aquaculture, environmental monitoring, and research.

## Features
- **Floating Design**: The robot can stay afloat on ponds, lakes, and reservoirs.
- **Sensor-Enabled Robotic Arm**: Equipped with sensors for accurate water quality measurements (e.g., pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature).
- **Wireless Communication**: Transmits real-time data to a remote monitoring system.
- **Autonomous Operation**: Can navigate autonomously or be manually controlled.
- **Data Logging and Analysis**: Logs water quality data for analysis and decision-making.

## Target Applications
- **Fish Farmers & Aquaculture**: Monitor water conditions to optimize aquatic health and growth.
- **Environmental Monitoring Agencies**: Track water quality in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs to ensure ecological balance.
- **Water Treatment Facilities**: Ensure treated water meets safety standards.
- **Research Institutions**: Collect water data for scientific studies.
- **Private Pond and Lake Owners**: Maintain optimal water conditions for private water bodies.
